      fitness, in no event shall NAIST be liable for
      any special, indirect or consequential damages or any damages
      whatsoever resulting from loss of use, data or profits, whether in an
      action of contract, negligence or other tortuous action, arising out
      of or in connection with the use or performance of this software.

      A large portion of the dictionary entries
      originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
      Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.

      Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
      original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
      that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
      on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
      in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
      distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
      contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
      jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.

      NO WARRANTY

      The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
      research and development conducted during the project and is provided
      to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
      program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
      implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
      includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
      performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
      the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
      any right of any third party.

      Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
      have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
      the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
      otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.

      Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
      organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
      development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
      officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
      damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
      and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
      with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
      or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
      regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
      knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
      project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
      foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
      "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
      modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
      production of secondary products from the program.

      In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
      modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
      any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
      grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
      writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
      from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
      above as far as the program is concerned.
